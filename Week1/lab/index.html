    <blockquote>
        My name is Joshua Pierce, I am 25 and I aspire to be a software developer. I predominantly work in
        Java but I have coded websites with HTML and CSS since I was in high school, and I must say
        I do not enjoy it as much as Java or Python. I am hoping this class concentrates is more on 
        Javascript and database work.
